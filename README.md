# This is a simple application to calculate your weight on other planets. 

Usage is quite simple. Type in your weight (in pounds), select your planet, and press calculate.

***Extra Features***

1. Some people agree with the IAU and don't want to include Pluto on the planets list (they're apparently fine with the Sun and Moon though...). I have begrudgingly included a checkbox to remove Pluto if desired.

2. If you're the opposite of the IAU people, I have included a place to add your own planet. Scroll down to the "Planet Name" box, type in the name, type in the multiplier (how strong its gravity is compared to Earth), and press the "Add Planet" button.
